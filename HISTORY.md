## 3.0.0

 * **breaking change**: emitted error object is now a valid Error instance. `namespace` and `req` are now stored inside `err.data` property.

 * fix: only error/errorNS methods emit errors
 * fix: same for development environment

## 1.1.x

 * **new**: `log/logNS` methods - synonyms to `info/infoNS`
 * **new**: `warn/warnNS` methods - synonyms to `error/errorNS`
 * `req` property is exposed in error events

## 1.0.x
